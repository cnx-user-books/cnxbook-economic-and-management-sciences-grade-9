      <title>PRODUCTIVITY</title>
      <para id="id1169659661041">Productivity can be described as <emphasis effect="italics">the amount of goods and services produced per worker per hour. This refers to the ratio between real production and the number of inputs that are needed to manufacture it</emphasis>; the productivity of labour increases, for example, if the output (the number of units that are produced) increases by 10% while the input (number of working hours) remains the same.</para>
      <para id="id1169656362306">There is an important relationship between productivity and economic growth in the sense that improved productivity always is a prerequisite for economic growth.</para>
      <para id="id1169656402188">For the effect of productivity on economic growth to be understood, it is necessary to distinguish between the following concepts:</para>
      <para id="id1169664160540">1. EXTENSIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH refers to the extension of total production of goods and services irrespective of whether there is increased productivity per person. According to this, extensive economic growth is possible even though there may be no increase in production per person</para>
      <para id="id1169639331679">2. INTENSIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH refers to the increase in production per person (or per capita). When intensive economic growth occurs, total production increases more rapidly than the population. Per capita growth (or income) therefore is an indicator of economic growth.</para>
      <para id="id1169647139190">When a communityâ€™s production of goods and services expands more rapidly than the population increases, real per capita income rises. This generally means that the economic prosperity of the population will increase, which reflects economic growth.</para>
      <para id="id1169648239970">Therefore: growth in production that is larger than growth in population leads to:</para>

        <item>economic prosperity</item>
      </list>
      <para id="id1169665045657">Inversely, a decrease in real per capita income will occur if the population increase is greater than the increase in production. Economic decline, the opposite of intensive growth, will therefore occur.</para>
      <para id="id1169665984710">Therefore: growth in production that is smaller than growth in population leads to</para>
      <list id="id1169656284766" list-type="bulleted">

        <item>decline in economic prosperity (rising poverty)</item>
      </list>
      <para id="id1169647507372">With increased productivity, the products of a country become more competitive on international markets and this can lead to increased exports. The reason for this is that </para>
      <para id="id1169647124932">increased productivity can absorb wage increases, which makes it possible for business enterprises to keep the prices of their products stable.</para>
